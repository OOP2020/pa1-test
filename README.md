## Test Code for PA1

This repository contains some JUnit 4 tests for PA1 ArrayIterator.

You need JUnit 4 libraries to run the tests. 

There is also test code for CSVReader.  If you do that assignment, then please contact instructor.

### Test Like a Pro?

See if you can add this repository to your code as a 
[Git Submodule][git-submodule].  "Submodule" enables you to add one git repository inside the tree of another git repository, so the two can be updated separately.  The submodule code is not part of your base repository.

**Don't** clone the test repo inside your source code using "git clone" (that will create a mess).  You need to use the `git submodule` command.

See "[Working with Git Submodules][working-with-submodules]" for how to.

If it doesn't work, just **copy** the test classes into your project.
